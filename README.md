# Next.js and MDX Blog
This is a simple blog built with Next.js and MDX files. Next.js is a React framework that allows for server-side rendering and other optimizations out of the box. MDX is a format that allows you to write Markdown and JSX together in the same file, allowing for rich content creation.

## ALL POSTS ARE GENERATED BY CHATGPT INCLUDING THIS README FILE!!

## Getting Started

To get started with this blog, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you've installed Node.js, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
# or 
yarn install
# then
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
